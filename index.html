                <h4>Imagine RIT Exhibit</h4>
                <p>Cocoon was created during the spring of our senior year at RIT. The project team consisted of 3
                    developers and 7 designers.


                    Designers worked on creating assets, animating these assets, set design, and audio. Developers made
                    the experience interactive, using Unity to bring the worlds to life. Developers also used arduino to
                    make the control panel for the environments functionable.

                    (De)composing is a 2D puzzle platformer with elements of rhythm games. It combines the visceral
                    action of platforming and rhythmic timing with the thoughtful rumination of puzzle-solving. The
                    experience will be elevated by aesthetic and auditory flavor, as well as a premise rooted in gallows
                    humor. The game will be especially enjoyed by fans of casual puzzle games or lovers of music, though
                    it will also serve as a great introduction to either.

                    The game is currently in development and an offical release date is unknown. Though a Demo can be
                    found on Itch.io</p>

                    While screen sharing, a lot of the menus go away, which is nice for the one whose sharing, however
                    things like what exactly is being shared can be hard to pinpoint. Specifically, the screen's audio
                    and it can be hard to figure out if something is wrong until someone else has to tell you. And then
                    finding the solution can also be difficult.

                    So having a quick, clear, and easy way to see this information is important.
